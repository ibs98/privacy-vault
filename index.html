        <h1>What set's Privacy Vault <br>apart from other solutions?</h1>
        <p>Privacy Vault’s end-to-end encryption uses multiple technologies to keep your data safe <br> and secure. First, all data is only stored in Tier 4 data centers, which is the highest <br> rating available today.  In the data center, we only use object storage to store user's <br> encrypted data. The great thing about object storage is there is no underlying file system <br> nor is all data stored in a single file. As the name suggests, all data is broken up into <br> separate “objects” that only our software can re-assemble. This means, if an attacker was <br> able to gain access to the underlying storage system the data is unreadable and unusable. <br> 

            <br>
            <br>
            Before your data ever begins to be transferred to your zero-knowledge vault, it is fully<br>  encrypted before being securely uploaded to our servers. Only you have the key to your <br> files and data you upload and under no circumstance will we ever be able to access your <br> data. Only you hold the key. This also means that if you lose your key, Privacy Vault <br> will be unable to assist in data recovery. <br> 
            
            <br>
            <br>
            When you create your account you will be asked to create a tokenized password or <br> secondary password. It is critical that this password is different than the password <br> used to log in to your vault. Your tokenized password or key will be able to unlock your <br> data in the event that your private key is unavailable, if you are on a new machine or <br> you lose your private key. We use a third-party tokenization service as we feel that <br> simply storing the data in a database that we manage is not in the best interest of our <br> customers or their privacy and security. </p>
